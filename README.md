# Gromacs Adapters for AT-Engine

This code defines a wrapper class `AtGmx`
for adapting the AT-Engine to different Gromacs versions.

The adapter code has a modern C++ version
as well as a legacy C version.

A list of (partially) supported or partially supported Gromacs versions
can found under the directory [gromacs-versions](src/gromacs-versions).
